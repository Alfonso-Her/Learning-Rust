Welcome to my Rust notebook!
Here I will be saving my work reading [*The Rust Programming Language *](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
I am not following the chapters order, I ask gemini to make a partition the chapters in chunks of chapters given my current CV.
With that we aim to optimize the learning pace

Feel free to suggest correction opening a PR, thank you in advanced!
